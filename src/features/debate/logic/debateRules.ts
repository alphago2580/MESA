    ## Simulation Protocol
    1. **Agent Analysis**: Each assigned agent (Household, Central Bank, Strategies, Govt) analyzes metrics relevant to their domain.
    2. **Debate & Friction**: Identify conflicting interests (e.g., Household wants higher wages vs Business wants lower costs; Central Bank wants high rates vs Govt wants low debt service).
    3. **Consensus Formation**: Simulate a negotiation or market equilibrium process over a 12-month horizon.
